# Faction tags need to start with 'faction_'

# Supported types:
# liege_titles, liege_titles_w_claimant, character

# The succession law factions have hard coded elements to ensure that the correct heir is shown in Plot and 
# Faction interfaces and that AI faction members vote for laws in accordance with the faction goal.
# The valid tags correspond to the law name: faction_succ_seniority, faction_succ_primogeniture, etc.
# (faction_succ_ultimogeniture is fully supported by the code, but not currently implemented)

# Political Parties shamelessly stolen from Vicky II
# Conservatives - Pro Status Quo
# Liberals - Anti-Taxation, Anti-Regulation, Pro Political Freedom, Neutral Social Services
# Socialists - Neutral Taxation, Pro-Regulation, Neutral Political Freedom, Pro Social Services
