dni;Direct Neural Interface;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dni_desc;The Direct Neural Interface, colloqially called a "skulltop," is the basic neural implant on which all neural cybernetics are based. The DNI consists of a miniature computer implant in the host's brain, directly connected to their neurons. It acts as an interpreter between human neural processing and more conventional computer signals, allowing additional subsequent implants to interact with the brain. Nearly all modern DNI designs also include a microwave transmission device allowing direct wireless connection to computer networks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iaei_mk_i;IAEI Mk I;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iaei_mk_i_desc;The Individual Analysis and Empathy Implant is a DNI-based cybernetic implant designed to facilitate communications and diplomacy. In addition to serving as an automatic translation system, the IAEI can analyze and identify facial microexpressions, keeping a running database of the immediate emotional reaction of anyone speaking with the host. IAEIs are often considered one of the more ethically dubious implant lines, but are nevertheless a common staple of professional negotiators and diplomats.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

odin_mk_i;Odin Mk I;;;;;;;;;;;;x
odin_mk_i_desc;The "Odin" Cybernetic Eye is a DNI-based cybernetic implant originally developed for military field commanders to supplement their HUD. The Odin contains a standard optical camera that performs the same function as a natural eyeball, but is also equipped with sensors that automatically identify and highlight common camoflage patterns and known military vehicle profiles. Its primary feature, however, is the ability to rapidly analyze available battlefield data, a feature that has made it popular with higher-ranking military officers as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

full_cybernetic_conversion;Full Cybernetic Conversion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
full_cybernetic_conversion_desc;This character's entire biological body has been replaced with an artificial one - neurological continuity has been maintained, but every element of the host body is now fully cybernetic. While this procedure is entirely possible with modern surgical and electronics technology, common opinions of it range from 'extremely creepy' to 'abominable desecration of the human form' - even most dedicated Cyberneticists find full-body conversions to be at least somewhat disturbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hiver_implant;Hiver Implant;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hiver_implant_desc;This character has been implanted with a Hiver Implant, a variation on the Direct Neural Interface that acts a direct connection to a distributed interstellar wireless network known as the Hive. The Hive is supposedly a gestalt of the many individuals that make it up, but suffers from a critical design flaw - it is incapable of reconciling the vast diversity of contrasting personalities and identities of its drones, and as a direct result, it suffers from severe schizophrenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10000;Your implants are certainly convenient, but you're starting to wonder if maybe they're TOO convenient. You've come to rely on them more and more. Perhaps you should try using them more conservatively, to make sure you don't become too reliant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10000;Why bother?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10000;I could certainly use the exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10005;You've begun to grow tired of your routine lovemaking, and hit upon the idea of making a wireless connection between your brain and your partner's. You'd both experience each others' pleasure, simultaneously.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10005;I just hope it won't get out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10006;Your nightly routine had started to get stale, before [From.GetFirstName] suggested you try leaving your implants connected. Feeling [From.GetHerHis] pleasure as well as your own was an amazing experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10006;We need to do that again sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10007;Last night, [From.GetFirstName] suggested that the two of you spice up your usual nightly activities by leaving your implants on and connected. The idea was that you'd feel [From.GetHerHis] pleasure, while [From.GetSheHe]'d feel yours. It worked. Perhaps a little too well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10007;Who am I again?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10011;You've made an important discovery. As part of your security duties, you hacked into [From.GetFullName]'s DNI, and discovered that [From.GetSheHe] is planning to [From.GetPlot]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10011;I'll need to do something about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10015;You haven't been maintaining your cybernetic limb properly recently. The metal is starting to get rusty at the point where prosthetic meets flesh, and it's cutting into your skin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10015;Ow ow ow ow ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10020;Each night, you lie in bed, thinking. It's strange, being half machine. The other children seem different now, more alien, as if you aren't human anymore. You're starting to wonder if you can ever get used to life like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10020;Dad will know what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10020;Mom will know what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCYBERNETICS10020;[Root.Guardian.GetFirstName] will know what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDCYBERNETICS10020;I can handle it. I know I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10021;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is full of anxious questions, lately. '...I don't feel... normal... anymore. What am I supposed to do with my metal parts? Am I a monster?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10021;Ignore [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10021;Try to console [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCYBERNETICS10021;Teach [From.GetHerHim] about being a cyborg.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDCYBERNETICS10021;Yes! Yes, you ARE a monster!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10022;You tried to talk to your [GetFromRelation] about how you've been feeling lately, but [From.GetSheHe] just ignored you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10022;I'll just have to deal with it on my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10023;You asked your [GetFromRelation] about how you'd been feeling lately. [From.GetSheHeCap] didn't seem mad, but all [From.GetSheHe] could say was things like 'just be yourself' or 'being a cyborg doesn't matter.' [From.GetSheHeCap] had no idea what [From.GetSheHe] was talking about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10023;You're just lying to make me feel better!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10024;Your [GetFromRelation] was kind and understanding. [From.GetSheHeCap] talked to you for a few hours about your new condition, and you feel like you might be able to handle it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10024;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10025;Talking to your [GetFromRelation] was the right thing to do. [From.GetSheHeCap] took you aside for a few hours and told you that you don't need to ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10100;You've been given the option to participate in a beta test for the next generation of software drivers for your Individual Analysis and Empathy Implant.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10100;Count me in!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCYBERNETICS10100;You're kidding, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10101;The beta test for your IAEI is now over. The data you gathered was put to good use, and the new software you tested has greatly improved your IAEI's functionality.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10101;So it was all worth it in the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10102;This beta-test hasn't exactly been smooth, but in the times when you CAN get your IAEI to function perfectly, it seems to work better than ever. You even think you might be starting to pick up some new skills of your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10102;At the very least, I know what DOESN'T work.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10105;The [Root.Liege.GetTitle]'s decision to call you in for a meeting took you completely by surprise. Normally, that might not have been such a bad thing, but your IAEI had been glitchier than usual today, and you MAY have accidentally insulted [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] parents.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10105;NO WAIT I DIDN'T MEAN THAT;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCYBERNETICS10106;You'd called [From.GetFullName] in for a meeting, and things had gotten off to a steady-but-rocky start when [From.GetSheHe] suddenly made some EXTREMELY rude comments about your parentage. You immediately narrow your eyes, and [From.GetSheHe] immediately widens [From.GetHerHis]s, waving [From.GetHerHis] hands and spluttering something about an IAEI beta test.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACYBERNETICS10106;...sure, let's go with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
