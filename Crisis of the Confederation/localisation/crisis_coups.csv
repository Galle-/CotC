launch_coup_decision_desc;Send an ultimatum to [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName], threatening civil war unless [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] hands you control of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP0;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [FROM.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nIt's time we brought this farce to a close. You are no longer fit to serve as [Root.GetTitle]. We demand that you tender your immediate resignation. If you've any love left for the people you've betrayed, you'll stand down, and spare them death at the hands of your butchers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP20;and [This.GetHerHis] supporters might start a civil war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBACKSCOUP;is a known supporter of [From.GetOnlyDynastyName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP10;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nYou win, you snake. For the sake of peace, I hereby surrender the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to you. May its people forgive me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP11;'Breaking news from the [From.Location.GetName] System tonight, as sources claim that [From.GetFullName] has unexpectedly resigned. [From.GetSheHeCap] explicitly named [From.GetHerHis] longstanding rival, [FromFrom.GetFullName] as acting leader of the new government, amidst accusations of foul play...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP12;It appears that your plot has succeeded beyond your wildest dreams. [FromFrom.GetFullName] has resigned from office and surrendered to [From.GetFullName], and all without firing a shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP20;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New management\nNever! Even if you tear [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] asunder, you'll never be able to do as much damage to my people with missiles as you could with my title. You and your followers are traitors, and will be dealt with as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP20;...damn, I was really hoping that would work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP100;You've already made the first move - and it failed. It's too late to turn back now. There's no possible way you could defend your actions to [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName], and you have no doubt that you'll be under arrest within the hour if you don't act immediately. The only options left are surrender and civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP100;Then war it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP100;No, civil war is too high a price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP102;will join you in open rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP103;will either join in open rebellion or plot your enemy's downfall from within.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP101;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: New Management\nI had thought you a better [Root.GetWomanMan] than this. Just remember, this war is on your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP102;Your initial strike failed, and [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName] is definitely onto you now. [From.GetFullName] has issued official orders proclaiming [From.GetHerselfHimself] the acting leader of the [From.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and has ordered all government institutions to join [From.GetHerHim] in overthrowing the corrupt leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP102;Make ready the fleet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP103;It has come to war at last. [From.GetFullName] has openly declared [From.GetHerselfHimself] the rightful ruler of the [From.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and has called on all of [From.GetHerHis] supporters to assist [From.GetHerHim] in removing [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName] from office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP103;Make ready the fleet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP103;I can do more damage by pretending I'm still loyal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP104;'Shots fired in the [From.Location.GetName] System as terrorists openly exchange fire with [From.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] forces. [From.GetFullName] broadcast a public speech declaring [From.GetHerselfHimself] the legitimate governor of the [From.PlotTarget.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and calling for open war against those still loyal to...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP120;Tracer beams glitter in the dark skies over the third world of the [Root.Location.GetName] System. This battle could potentially decide the outcome of the civil war, and your squadron is currently heading toward the worst of the fighting. The Loyalists actually believe you're on their side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP120;Open fire! Target the Loyalists!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP121;Things are beginning to look bleak, as yet another squadron of Loyalist reinforcements jump in, led by a ship you recognize as the [From.Religon.GetRandomEvilGodName], [From.GetFullName]'s flagship. You are about to order a missile salvo when they open fire - on the other Loyalists. Your crew cheers as Loyalist ships explode.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP121;Reset IFF, tag the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] forces as friendlies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP200;You lay aside the latest intelligence reports. You know that [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName] is in the [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] System, and your forces are already in position to strike. With one swift move, you could capture the [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitle] and accomplish your goals before any loyalists could react.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP200;All units, move out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP200;No, the time is not yet right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP201;is informed of your plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP202;will detect your incoming fleet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP203;comes under attack by your forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP201;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: Events in motion\nMy forces are on their way to the [From.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] System to apprehend [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName]. Be prepared to move should the initial strike fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP202;Something is wrong. Over the past two days, [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName] has been bringing more and more ships into the [From.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] System - ships that are urgently needed elsewhere, and captained by officers who have often spoken out publicly against the [From.PlotTarget.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP202;Put all squadrons on high alert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP202;I'm sure it's nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP204;Typical. You put all that effort into a plan to seize power from [FromFrom.GetFullName], and then [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has the nerve to fall from power on [FromFrom.GetHerHis] own time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP204;You have got to be kidding me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP210;You stand in your command center, leaning over a holotank console, listening to reports filter in from [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName]. You could cut the tension with a knife. Early combat reports were only sporadic, but it's only a matter of time before someone realizes what your marines are up to. That is, until a flickering image of a marine captain appears in the air before you.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], he says, 'we've got [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHim]. We're returning to command now.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP210;Well done, captain, mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP211;surrenders the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP211;An explosion rocks you from your sleep.\n\nYou sit up, still not quite awake. It's the middle of the night, and you're beginning to wonder just what the hell that noise was. You almost think you hear gunfire, but that would be absurd, wouldn't it?\n\nA loud bang catches your attention, and you turn to see the entrance to your quarters slide open and a junior aide step through, only to fall immediately to the ground, blood pouring from [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHis] chest. The [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] marine behind [Root.job_chancellor.GetHerHim] walks into the room and pulls you from your bed before tapping [From.GetHerHis] comlink.\n\n'[From.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], we've got [Root.GetHerHim].';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP211;This... this is treason! I'll have your head for this, [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP212;Breaking news, live from the [From.Location.GetName] System! We're still getting only scattered reports, but it appears that forces under the command of [FromFrom.GetTitle] [FromFrom.GetFullName] have opened fire on other [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] units.\n\nThere is no clear word yet on the status of [From.GetTitle] [From.GetFullName], but all signs suggest that [From.GetSheHe] may have already been captured by [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP212;...what will happen to us now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOUP212;Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCOUP212;Damn, we were too late!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP220;You stand in your command center, leaning over a holotank console, listening to reports filter in from the capital. You could cut the tension with a knife. Early combat reports were only sporadic, but it's only a matter of time before someone realizes what your marines are up to. That is, until a flickering image of a marine captain appears in the air before you.\n\n'[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]! [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], [FromFrom.GetSheHe]'s not here! [FromFrom.GetSheCap] got away!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP220;Then FIND [FromFrom.GetHerHim]! NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCOUP221;escapes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOUP222;A pleasant night's sleep is cut short by someone shaking you awake. You manage to stir yourself to consciousness, making out the vague form of one of your junior aides. 'It's important, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA],' [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] says in a hushed whisper.\n\nYou manage to regain enough clarity to ask for details. 'It's... it's the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName],' [Root.job_chancellor.GetSheHe] says, 'security caught one of their SpecOps teams on the palace grounds, planting explosives. [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]'s already landed an armor column. We need to get you to a secure location right now, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA]!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOUP223;So it's come to this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
